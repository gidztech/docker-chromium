# docker-chromium

![Tests](https://github.com/gidztech/docker-chromium/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
**Node library for controlling a Chromium instance running in a Docker container**

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/docker-chromium.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docker-chromium)

## Installation

**Requirements:**

-   [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

```
npm install --save docker-chromium
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
const {
    dockerSetChromiumConfig,
    dockerRunChromium,
    dockerShutdownChromium
} = require("docker-chromium");

(async () => {
    await dockerSetChromiumConfig({
        revision: "123456",
        flags: [' -–ignore-certificate-errors']
    });
    const webSocketUri = await dockerRunChromium();
    // do some other stuff...
    await dockerShutdownChromium();
})();
```

Default is trying to connect to Chromium 5 times with a 500 milisecond interval between each attempt. You can customize timeout/attempts by passing arguments to `dockerRunChromium`:

```javascript
// ...
const webSocketUri = await dockerRunChromium({
    maxAttempts: 10,
    retryInterval: 5000 // 5 seconds
});
```

Or by defining environment variables `DOCKER_CHROMIUM_MAX_ATTEMPTS` and `DOCKER_CHROMIUM_RETRY_INTERVAL`. Passing arguments to `dockerRunChromium` takes precedence over environment variables.

### Usage with a specified image
A specific image to be used can be set via the configuration or the environment variable. This is especially useful if you use an arm processor (Apple silicon) and the image you'll use
is platform compatible (more on this on [this repo](https://github.com/bertuz/docker-chromium-img))


```javascript
const {
    dockerSetChromiumConfig,
    dockerRunChromium,
    dockerShutdownChromium
} = require("docker-chromium");

(async () => {
    await dockerSetChromiumConfig({
        image: 'bertuz/docker-chromium:chromium103.0.5060.53',
        // this property will be used when running the image
        flags: [' -–ignore-certificate-errors'],
        // this property will be ignored: the image is built already
        revision: "123456",
    });
    const webSocketUri = await dockerRunChromium();
    // do some other stuff...
    await dockerShutdownChromium();
})();
```

Alternatively, you can set the `DOCKER_CHROMIUM_USE_IMAGE` environment variable, but the config's property will take precedence on it, if passed. 

## How it works

`docker-chromium` pulls a pre-built Docker image running a version of Chromium specified by you from a Docker Hub repository. You can then fetch the WebSocket URI to connect to the instance in your own application. If the pre-built image is unavailable or corrupt (rare case), a backup mechanism is in place, which builds the image from scratch locally instead.

### Update

Due to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS transitioning to ESM support, we have had to upgrade the Ubuntu version to 18.04 LTS. The Dockerfile used in the pre-built version in Docker Hub remains on the old version. Until this is changed, we have to disable this option for the time being.

## API

### dockerSetChromiumConfig

Function which is used for the configuration of Chromium, before running it with `dockerRunChromium`.

##### Example of usage

```javascript
await dockerSetChromiumConfig({
    revision: '123456',
    flags: [' -–ignore-certificate-errors']
});
```

##### Arguments

-   `revision: string`
    -   **Required**
    -   Describes version number for Chromium
-   `flags: string[]`
    -   _Optional_
    -   _Defaults_ to `process.env.CHROMIUM_ADDITIONAL_ARGS`
    -   Describes command line flags that Chromium accepts.
-   `downloadHost: string`

    -   _Optional_
    -   _Defaults_ to `process.env.PUPPETEER_DOWNLOAD_HOST || process.env.npm_config_puppeteer_download_host || process.env.npm_package_config_puppeteer_download_host || 'https://storage.googleapis.com'`
    -   Describes host address for downloading of Chromium.
    -   Describes only the beginning of address, like this rule: `$CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST/chromium-browser-snapshots/Linux_x64/$REV/chrome-linux.zip` - `$CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST` describes `downloadHost` argument
    -   Example: If we run `dockerSetChromiumConfig({downloadHost: 'https://internal.service.com, revision: 99999})`, it means that Chromium snapshot will be downloaded from _https://internal.service.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/Linux_x64/99999/chrome-linux.zip_

-   `useClosestUbuntuMirror: boolean`
    -   _Optional_
    -   _Defaults_ to `process.env.USE_CLOSEST_UBUNTU_MIRROR || process.env.npm_config_use_closest_ubuntu_mirror || process.env.npm_package_config_use_closest_ubuntu_mirror|| false`
    -   Flag for setting whether Ubuntu should use the default mirror for fetching packages, or pick the closest mirror depending on location

### dockerRunChromium

Function which is used to build and run the Docker container.

##### Example of usage

```javascript
const webSocketUri = await dockerRunChromium({
    maxAttempts: 10,
    retryInterval: 5000
});
```

##### Arguments

-   `maxAttempts: number`
    -   _Optional_
    -   _Defaults_ to 5
    -   Describes number of attempts to connect to Chromium in the launched container (sometimes it fails).
-   `retryInterval: number`
    -   _Optional_
    -   _Defaults_ to 500
    -   Describes number of milliseconds between attempts to connect to Chromium in the launched container.

##### Returns

-   `Promise<string>`
    -   Returns web socket URI to the launched Chromium in the container.
    -   By using this URI we can connect to Chromium and control it.

### dockerShutdownChromium

Function which is used to shutdown the launched Docker container.

##### Example of usage

```javascript
await dockerShutdownChromium();
```
